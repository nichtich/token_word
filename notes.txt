Format for document files:

A list of chunks, one per line:
<chunkUsername, chunkID, chunkRegionOffset, chunkRegionLength; 
 docUserName, docID, docRegionOffset >



Document-specific values are optional.

Note that a "docRegionLength" is not included, since it would be redundant
(identical to chunkRegionLength).




Examples:

<jd45, 12, 104, 20>


<jd45, 12, 104, 20; dpj, 14, 1304>

<q 15>
I am also quoting David's father, who said:
<q 23>

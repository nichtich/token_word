Instructions for installing token_word at your site.


1.  Make a directory for token_word inside your cgi-bin directory, we suggest
    calling this directory "tw", and we will use that as the directory name
    throughout this document.

2.  Copy tokenWord.pl into cgi-bin/tw.  Make sure it is executable
    by the process that runs your CGI scripts.

3.  Edit the first line of tokenWord.pl so that the perl path matches
    that of your local installation.

4.  Copy the tokenWord and htmlTemplates directories into cgi-bin/tw.  
    Make sure they and their contents are readable by the process that 
    runs your CGI scripts.

5.  Edit cgi-bin/tw/htmlTemplates/depositConfirm.html
	--Change "jcr13@users.sourceforge.net" to the email address associated
      with your site's paypal account.
	--Change the "return" and "cancel-return" parameter value URLs to 
	  http://myserver.com/cgi-bin/tw/tokenWord.pl
    --Change the "notify_url" parameter value URLs to
	  http://myserver.com/cgi-bin/tw/tokenWord.pl

6.  Make a directory at the same level as cgi-bin called "cgi-data".  Make
    this directory writable by the process that runs CGI scripts on your
    web server (may need to be world writable).  token_word will automatically
    create its data structures inside the directory cgi-data/tokenWordData (it
    will make the tokenWordData directory automatically).

7.  Open http://myserver.com/cgi-bin/tw/tokenWord.pl with a web browser.
    The "login" page should be displayed.

8.  Check that cgi-data/tokenWordData has been created.

9.  If step 7 or 8 fails, look in cgi-bin/tw/tokenWord_errors.log for
    error messages.
